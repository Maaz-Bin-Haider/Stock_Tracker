# SwissTech Stock Tracker Project Context

This root-level context file is maintained so future work can continue from the latest project state without reading every document first.

## Current Repository

- Repository folder: `Stock_Tracker`
- Purpose: plan and build a professional web-based inventory system to replace the current spreadsheet workflow.
- Original workbook reference: `data/source/stock_tracker_original.xlsx`
- Application implementation has not started yet.

## Key Documents

- `README.md`: repository overview and document map.
- `docs/requirements/PROJECT_CONTEXT.md`: detailed requirements gathering history.
- `docs/requirements/SYSTEM_SPEC.md`: implementation-oriented system specification.
- `docs/requirements/SRS.md`: formal Software Requirements Specification.
- `docs/business-flow/EXECUTION_FLOW_NON_TECHNICAL.md`: non-technical execution flow from new system setup to daily/monthly use.
- `docs/architecture/SYSTEM_DIAGRAMS.md`: use case, activity, sequence, class, and ER diagrams.
- `docs/architecture/diagrams/pdf/`: PDF exports of individual diagrams rendered from the Mermaid diagram source.

## Current Requirements Summary

- Web-based inventory system.
- Single company for now, future multi-company design possible.
- Desktop/web first, responsive for mobile.
- AWS deployment later after local testing, initially possible on one EC2 instance.
- Stock ledger is the source of truth.
- Purchases can contain multiple product lines.
- Purchase collection is separate from purchase entry.
- Purchase refunds/cancellations happen from a separate page by selecting the original invoice and product line.
- Refunds/cancellations use reversal entries and must reverse stock and GST where relevant.
- Sales happen only from Dubai and Karachi.
- Shipments track source stock, in-transit stock, destination receiving, partial receiving, and over-receiving warnings.
- GST report is product-line based and uses net quantity after refund/cancellation.
- All important user actions must be audited.

## Roles

- Admin: full access.
- Purchase user: purchases, purchase collection, purchase refunds/cancellations, and product creation during purchase flow.
- Sale user: sales only for create/update/delete, with view access to system data.
- Viewer: read-only.

## Open Items

- Confirm who can create, update, and delete shipments. Current safe default is admin-only.
- Backup schedule, retention, and restore process are deferred.
- Final report columns can be refined after business review.
- Final AWS architecture will be decided after local testing.

## Documentation Maintenance Rule

After each project change, update this file with:

- what changed
- which documents/files were updated
- any new open items
- the next recommended step

If a change affects requirements, workflows, permissions, entities, database design, or reports, also update the matching detailed document under `docs/`.
